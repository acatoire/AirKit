The project is part of a kit designed for people that assembly their own Air Flow Heater.

The arduino master board will activate an airflow threw a solar panel depending of the temperature delta between the room and the solar panel.



### The system ###
The system is composed of the following elements:
* One master unit
* One in house temperature sensor
* One outside temperature sensor
* One low flow fan
* One electric controlled air gate

In option can be added (not implemented yet)
* One HMI (Human Machine Interface = Screen and Buttons)

THe whole system is powered on 5V in order to be able to run on basic 5V solar batteries.
